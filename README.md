# Mini Project
 
The final output will be a detailed report with visualization/modeling/CV. In the discussion section, please includ what is your find out on the input data/any pattern/relation and potential usage of your finding.

Another thing: make sure you are using the same language, same tool together. (don't use R and python together, or python and jupyter notebook). Make the branch clean and straightforward.

Since it is only a miniproject. Please don't too much time on the details and just make the main part correct. We will also go over it this week. Hope it helps.

###  Our goal is to try to predict fight winner based off the predictors available.
Winner is the response column. If you look at the data, it is all split between the red fighter and the blue fight.
